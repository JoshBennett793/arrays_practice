1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

	I feel very confident in my understanding of the content on arrays so far.

2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

	I don't feel additional learning is necessary before moving on to the next lesson.

3. What questions do you have about Arrays?

	I would like more practice with other array methods such as .map() and .filter() but I'm sure there will come a time to practice those. Understanding the concepts of an array method has proven to be easier for me than actually implementing them in a project. I don't want to get too ahead of the current curriculum and confuse others.
